# ZeroBot
A Discord bot written in python using discord.py. Currently still in development, hence not yet running.
## Current Features
### Polls
Makes a poll in a variety of formats.
### Backend-Nerdstuff
Things like logging, errorhandling and administrative commands that users will probably never see.
### Miscellaneous
Miscellaneous things that do not need a seperate module.
## Planned Features
### Restrictions & Prefixes
Enables each guild to dis/enable just the stuff they need and set their own prefix.
### Google Calendar Integration
Posts upcoming events in a specified channel and notifies when they begin.
### Tags
Are you saying the same thing over and over again? Define a tag and let the bot do the typing.
### Guildwars 2 & Planetside 2 integration
Lowest priority, may never happen. Integrates Stat and Event tracking for both games.
